        <p><em>Comercial Director and Project Manager at <strong><a href="http://www.psgevents.es/">PSG Events</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>In 2009, I began my studies at university. For the next four years, I studied business and enterprise managemt.In 2013, I started my professional carreer working for <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/es/es.html">Deloitte</a>, one the
          biggest
          advisory and audit companies in the country. I
          entered in the audit department and worked for 3 years as an auditor, the companies, which I worked for belonged to the energy and media sector. In September 2017, I decided to started up my own businness, I found <a
            href="http://www.dos-setenta.com/">Factory Dos Setenta</a>, a company
          dedicated to desserts. The things didn't as well as I expected, so after three years of hard work and bad results I decided to change the activity of my business and add the catering service. After that change, I also (following my dad's
          advises)
          merged the company with his one, our services are complement the other (his company organize the events and promotions for big companies in the country). Nowadays, my main function inside the enterprise is to find new clients and develop
          new
          business. My thinking about the companies has changed drastically from the beginning of my labour life, and now I am focus on sales, the vital operation of every single company. </p>
